Small maintenance release, including:

  - When loading a configuration from the classpath, a `FileNotFoundException` is thrown
    (issue #8) -- Martin Konicek
  - Looking for a non existing key will throw a `NoSuchElementException` with a message
    clearly refering to the missing key (issue #11) -- Jussi Virtanen
  - List values are sanitized by adding quotes when needed (issue #12)
  - Artefacts for Scala 2.9.2
