Configrity standard formats accepts an `include` directive. This allow
the parsing of *Akka* configuration files as well as most legacy
*Configgy* files.

New features since version 0.7.0:

  - Setting a list in a configuration will automatically does not
    require anymore proper formatting.
  - An `include` directive is supported in both `FlatFormat` and
    `BlockFormat`.
  - `BlockFormat` parser ignores empty blocks without complaining.
